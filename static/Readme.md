## Autogenerated Explorviz Build

The files in this archive have been built according to a configuration on the Explorviz configurator.

Depending on the selected extensions, additional configuration may be required. The required information for this can be found at the individual extension pages on Github.

For the docker launch, only Docker is required.

### Launching (Direct)

For the direct launch the following tools must be installed on the system

- A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) suitable for running the selected Explorviz version
- A nginx Webserver

Additional dependencies may be required by some extensions.

To start the Explorviz configuration, simply run `launch.sh`. The Explorviz Frontend should now be available at `http://localhost:8081`.

### Launching (Docker)

For running a configuration via Docker, only Docker and Docker Compose are required.

Additional dependencies may be required by some extensions. These need to be added to the respective Dockerfiles in the docker/ subdirectory.

To start the Explorviz configuration, simply run `docker-compose up --build`. The Explorviz Frontend should now be available at `http://localhost:8081`.
